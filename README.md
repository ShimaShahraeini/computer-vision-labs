# Advanced Computer Vision – MATLAB Lab Sessions

This repository contains MATLAB-based lab materials used in the **PhD-level Advanced Computer Vision** course. The content covers hands-on exercises aligned with theoretical lectures, designed and taught by Shima Shahraeini as a Teaching Assistant.

> 🔍 These materials include exercises on image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and an introduction to machine learning and deep learning using MATLAB.

## 🧠 Sessions Overview

### Session 1: Preprocessing and Color Spaces
- Contrast enhancement using histogram equalization
- Introduce spatial filters (Noise reduction using spatial filters)
- Image segmentation using thresholding
- Color-based segmentation using color space conversion (RGB → HSV, LAB, etc.)

### Session 2: Edge Detection, Morphology, and Clustering
- Edge detection and its algorithms (especially using Sobel and Canny algorithms)
- Morphological operations to improve segmentation results
- K-means clustering for unsupervised segmentation
- Geometric transformations: affine and projective

### Session 3: Feature Detection & Matching, Machine Learning
- Feature detection: Harris, SIFT, and SURF
- Feature matching and parameter tuning
- Supervised classification using MATLAB’s Classification Learner (k-NN)
- Short introduction to Deep Learning Designer (for project-level use)

## 📚 Acknowledgment

Many of the scripts and exercises in this repository are adapted from coursework in the following MathWorks Coursera Specializations:

- [Image Processing for Engineering and Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/image-processing)
- [Computer Vision for Engineering and Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-vision)

These materials were modified, extended, and structured by me to fit the objectives of the **Advanced Computer Vision** PhD-level lab sessions at Islamic Azad University of Mashhad.
